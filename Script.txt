1. We're going to make a game!
2. ... but we'll need a character ...
3. This is Froggy!
4. We want to make Froggy JUMP!
5. A computer doesn't know what a Frog is ...
6. Computers only know MATHS!
7. We can create a FORCE to push Froggy UP
8. Set the STRENGTH of the force
9. Gravity doesn't exist in a computer
10. Gravity is another FORCE that pushes DOWN
11. Combine up and down forces!
12. We want to push horizontally
13. Define the strength
14. Combine all 3 forces
15. and make a JUMP!
16. The jump is a SYMMETRICAL parabola
17. We need to animate Froggy
18. We can use the values of the parabola! 2/6
19. We can use the values of the parabola! 3/6
20. We can use the values of the parabola! 4/6
21. We can use the values of the parabola! 5/6
22. We can use the values of the parabola! 6/6
23. We need something we can avoid to add CHALLENGE
24. This lava ball will work, but it doesn't MOVE
25. We need to use MATHS to find a way to move the ball UP and DOWN
26. The Sine function produced a value that makes a WAVE
27. If we use the Sine value with X as TIME we can use the Y value to move it up and down!
28. The FREQUENCY of a wave determines how often it appears, and the AMPLITUDE how high it is
29. Set the movement of the ball
30. Let's get Froggy moving!
31. Let's move the platforms around ... but we want them to keep CHANGING
32. We need to make sure Froggy can always jump to the next platform ...
33. Adjust the ANGLE of variation in platform position so it matches the PARABOLA of Froggy's jump!
34. How far can you go?
35. Define a BRONZE, SILVER and GOLD medal value!
